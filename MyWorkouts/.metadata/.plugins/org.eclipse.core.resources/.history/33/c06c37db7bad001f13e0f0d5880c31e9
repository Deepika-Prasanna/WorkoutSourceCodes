/*
 * Singleton Pattern Integrity: 
 * 		While reflection allows breaking the Singleton pattern, it's generally considered an attack on the pattern. 
 * 		Developers can protect against this by adding checks inside the constructor to prevent multiple instances from being 
 * 		created through reflection. For example, you can throw an exception if the instance is already created.
